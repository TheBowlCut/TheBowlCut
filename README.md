- 👋 Hi, I’m @TheBowlCut
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Android Studio to develop some new skills outside of my day job as a thermal systems engineer for renewable companies in research.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything. One thing engineering has tought me is that no problem is too big.
- Just because you've not done it in the past, doesn't mean it can't be done in the future.
- 📫 How to reach me: Ping me an email on thebowlcut55@gmail.com
